# PhysicalLine

Example of wrapping 2d lines around circles like the Carried Away game.

Uses tangent calculation from origin and destination points to wrap the line around but unfortunately it creates too many points.
Performance fix for this left as an exercise for the reader (perhaps using angles?)
